# First Level Heading

A post article MUST have one and only one first level Heading.
And optionally, it can have multiple sections.

## Second Level Heading

A section is a part of the article that can have its own headings.
It can also have further subsections.

Semantic paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

So this line starts a new semantic paragraph.
This line belongs to a paragraph, together with the previous line.
The next line will start a code block, but *this* line is still part of the paragraph.
+++ code
# This is a code block.
def example_function():
	print("Hello, World!")

# Another function definition
def another_function():
	print("This is another function.")
+++
Ordinary lines after a code block still belong to the "semantic paragraph", but will start a new paragraph.
Blank space, `#` comment inside a code block should NOT be interpreted as a new paragraph, nor new section.

### Third Level Heading

This is a 3rd level subsection.

## Another 2nd Level Heading

This section is be the member of the first level section.

=== Fuzzy major heading

--- Fuzzy minor heading
