<h1>First Level Heading</h1>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
A post article MUST have one and only one first level Heading.
And optionally, it can have multiple sections.
</p>
</s-paragraph>
<h2>Second Level Heading</h2>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
A section is a part of the article that can have its own headings.
It can also have further subsections.
</p>
</s-paragraph>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
Semantic paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
</p>
</s-paragraph>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
So this line starts a new semantic paragraph.
This line belongs to a paragraph, together with the previous line.
The next line will start a code block, but *this* line is still part of the paragraph.
</p>
<pre>
# This is a code block.
def example_function():
	print("Hello, World!")

# Another function definition
def another_function():
	print("This is another function.")
</pre>
<p>
Ordinary lines after a code block still belong to the "semantic paragraph", but will start a new paragraph.
Blank space, `#` comment inside a code block should NOT be interpreted as a new paragraph, nor new section.
</p>
</s-paragraph>
<h3>Third Level Heading</h3>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
This is a 3rd level subsection.
</p>
</s-paragraph>
<h2>Another 2nd Level Heading</h2>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
This section is be the member of the first level section.
</p>
</s-paragraph>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
=== Fuzzy major heading
</p>
</s-paragraph>
<s-paragraph>
<p>
--- Fuzzy minor heading
</p>
</s-paragraph>
